    abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently—those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90\% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

    abstract = {Important properties of a particle, wave or a statistical system depend on the form of a dispersion relation (DR). Two commonly-discussed dispersion relations are the gapless phonon-like DR and the DR with the energy or frequency gap. More recently, the third and intriguing type of DR has been emerging in different areas of physics: the DR with the gap in momentum, or k-space. It has been increasingly appreciated that gapped momentum states (GMS) have important implications for dynamical and thermodynamic properties of the system. Here, we review the origin of this phenomenon in a range of physical systems, starting from ordinary liquids to holographic models. We observe how GMS emerge in the Maxwell–Frenkel approach to liquid viscoelasticity, relate the k-gap to dissipation and observe how the gaps in DR can continuously change from the energy to momentum space and vice versa. We subsequently discuss how GMS emerge in the two-field description which is analogous to the quantum formulation of dissipation in the Keldysh–Schwinger approach. We discuss experimental evidence for GMS, including the direct evidence of gapped DR coming from strongly-coupled plasma. We also discuss GMS in electromagnetic waves and non-linear Sine–Gordon model. We then move on to discuss the recently developed quasihydrodynamic framework which relates the k-gap with the presence of a softly broken global symmetry and its applications. Finally, we review recent discussions of GMS in relativistic hydrodynamics and holographic models. Throughout the review, we point out essential physical ingredients required by GMS to emerge and make links between different areas of physics, with the view that new and deeper understanding will benefit from studying the GMS in seemingly disparate fields and from clarifying the origin of potentially similar underlying physical ideas and equations.},

    abstract = {A large and mostly unexplored part of the phase diagram lies above the critical point. The supercritical matter was traditionally believed to be physically homogeneous with no discernible differences between liquidlike and gaslike states. More recently, several proposals have been put forward challenging this view, and here we review the history of this research. About a decade ago, it was proposed that the Frenkel line (FL), corresponding to the dynamical transition of particle motion and related thermodynamic and structural transitions, gives a unique and path-independent way to separate the supercritical states into two qualitatively different states and extends to arbitrarily high pressure and temperature on the phase diagram. Here, we review several lines of enquiry that followed. We focus on the experimental evidence of transitions in deeply supercritical Ne, N2, CH4, C2H6, CO2 and H2O at the FL detected by a number of techniques including X-ray, neutron and Raman scattering experiments. We subsequently summarise other developments in the field: recent extensions of analysis of dynamics at the FL, quantum simulations, topological and geometrical approaches, the universality of properties at the FL including transport properties, their fundamental bounds and the implications of the supercritical crossover for astrophysics and planetary science. Finally, we review current theoretical understanding of the supercritical state including its thermodynamic theory and list open problems in the field.},

    abstract = {A vibrational model of transport properties of dense fluids assumes that solid-like oscillations of atoms around their temporary equilibrium positions dominate the dynamical picture. The temporary equilibrium positions of atoms do not form any regular structure and are not fixed, unlike in solids. Instead, they are allowed to diffuse and this is why liquids can flow. However, this diffusive motion is characterized by much longer time scales compared to those of solid-like oscillations. Although this general picture is not particularly new, only in a recent series of works it has been possible to construct a coherent and internally consistent quantitative description of transport properties such as self-diffusion, shear viscosity, and thermal conductivity. Moreover, the magnitudes of these transport coefficients have been related to the properties of collective excitations in dense fluids. Importantly, the model is simple and no free parameters are involved. Recent achievements are summarized in this overview. Application of the vibrational model to various single-component model systems such as plasma-related Coulomb and screened Coulomb (Yukawa) fluids, the Lennard-Jones fluid, and the hard-sphere fluid is considered in detail. Applications to real liquids are also briefly discussed. Overall, good to excellent agreement with available numerical and experimental data is demonstrated. Conditions of applicability of the vibrational model and a related question concerning the location of the gas–liquid dynamical crossover are discussed.},

Physical properties of an interacting system are governed by collective excitations, but their nature at extreme supercritical conditions is unknown. Here, we present direct evidence for propagating solid-like longitudinal phonon-like excitations with wavelengths extending to interatomic separations deep in the supercritical state at temperatures up to 3,300 times the critical temperature. We observe that the crossover of dispersion curves develops at
k
points reducing with temperature. We interpret this effect as the crossover from the collective phonon to the collisional mean-free path regime of particle dynamics and find that the crossover points are close to both the inverse of the shortest available wavelength in the system and to the particle mean free path inferred from experiments and theory. Notably, both the shortest wavelength and mean free path scale with temperature with the same power law, lending further support to our findings.},

Self-diffusion in fluids has been thoroughly studied numerically, but even for simple liquids just a few scaling relationships are known. Relations between diffusion, excitation spectra, and character of the interparticle interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we show that diffusion mobility of particles in simple fluids increases linearly on the liquid branch of the liquid–gas binodal, from the triple point almost up to the critical point. With molecular dynamics simulations, we considered bulk systems of particles interacting via a generalised Lennard–Jones potential, as well as ethane. Using a two-oscillator model for the analysis of excitations, we observed that the mobility (inverse diffusion) coefficient on the liquid–gas binodal increases linearly above the triple point until the dispersion of high-frequency spectra has a solid-like (oscillating) shape. In terms of a separate mode analysis (of longitudinal and transverse modes), this corresponds to crossed modes in the intermediate range of wavenumbers
q
, between the hydrodynamic regime (small
q
) and the regime of individual particle motion (large
q
). The results should be interesting for a broad community in physics and chemistry of fluids, since self-diffusion is among the most fundamental transport phenomena, important for prospective chemical technologies, micro-, nanofluidics, and biotechnologies.},

Simulations predict that liquids exhibit a k-gap in wave-vector space, where solid-like transverse waves reappear above this gap. Experimental evidence in classical liquids has been limited, observed only in 2D dusty plasmas. Here, we investigate this phenomenon using active Brownian vibrators and uncover distinct gas-like and liquid-like phases depending on the packing fraction. We measure key properties, including pair correlation functions, mean square displacements, velocity auto-correlation functions, and vibrational density of states. In the liquid-like phase, we confirm the k-gap in transverse excitations, whose size grows as the packing fraction decreases and eventually disappears in the gas phase. Our findings extend the concept of the k-gap to active granular systems and reveal striking parallels with supercritical fluids.},

We present a computer simulation study of the phase diagram and anomalous behavior of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) classical particles repelling each other through an isotropic core-softened potential. As in the analogous three-dimensional case, in 2D a reentrant-melting transition occurs upon compression under not too high pressure, along with a spectrum of thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies in the fluid phase. However, in two dimensions the order of the region of anomalous diffusion and the region of structural anomaly is inverted in comparison with the 3D case, where there exists a water-like sequence of anomalies, and has a silica-like sequence. In the low density part of the 2D phase diagram, melting is a continuous two-stage transition, with an intermediate hexatic phase. All available evidence supports the Kosterlitz–Thouless–Halperin–Nelson–Young (KTHNY) scenario for this melting transition. On the other hand, at high density part of the phase diagram one first-order transition takes place.},

This strategy is applied to derive reversible reference system propagator algorithms (RESPA) that greatly accelerate simulations of systems with a separation of time scales or with long range forces. The new algorithms have all of the advantages of previous RESPA integrators but are reversible, and more stable than those methods. These methods are applied to a set of paradigmatic systems and are shown to be superior to earlier methods. It is shown how the new RESPA methods are related to predictor–corrector integrators. Finally, we show how these methods can be used to accelerate the integration of the equations of motion of systems with Nosé thermostats.},

    abstract = {Monolayer and two-dimensional (2D) systems exhibit rich phase behavior, compared with 3D systems, in particular, due to the hexatic phase playing a central role in melting scenarios. The attraction range is known to affect critical gas–liquid behavior (liquid–liquid in protein and colloidal systems), but the effect of attraction on melting in 2D systems remains unstudied systematically. Here, we have revealed how the attraction range affects the phase diagrams and melting scenarios in a 2D system. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we have considered the generalized Lennard-Jones system with a fixed repulsion branch and different power indices of attraction from long-range dipolar to short-range sticky-sphere-like. A drop in the attraction range has been found to reduce the temperature of the gas–liquid critical point, bringing it closer to the gas–liquid–solid triple point. At high temperatures, attraction does not affect the melting scenario that proceeds through the cascade of solid–hexatic (Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless) and hexatic–liquid (first-order) phase transitions. In the case of dipolar attraction, we have observed two triple points inherent in a 2D system: hexatic–liquid–gas and crystal–hexatic–gas, the temperature of the crystal–hexatic–gas triple point is below the hexatic–liquid–gas triple point. This observation may have far-reaching consequences for future studies, since phase diagrams determine possible routes of self-assembly in molecular, protein, and colloidal systems, whereas the attraction range can be adjusted with complex solvents and external electric or magnetic fields. The results obtained may be widely used in condensed matter, chemical physics, materials science, and soft matter.},

    abstract = {It is largely accepted that liquids are characterized by a short-range order usually corresponding to that of the solid phase at the same density. It is less clear to what extent dynamic properties of liquids and crystals can be compared. In particular, high-frequency collective excitations reminiscent of phonons in solids exist as well in liquids. They are however traditionally discussed in terms of relaxation processes characteristic of the liquid phase. We report here on a quantitative comparison of the collective excitations in liquid and polycrystalline sodium. We show that liquid sodium exhibits acoustic excitations of both longitudinal and transverse polarization at frequencies strictly related to those of the corresponding crystal. The only relevant difference between the liquid and the polycrystal appears in the broadening of the excitations: An additional disorder-induced contribution comes into play in the case of the liquid, which we show to be related to the distribution of local structures around the average one. These results establish a direct connection between structural and dynamic properties of liquids, with short-range order and overall structural disorder leaving very specific fingerprints.},

    abstract = {Strongly interacting, dynamically disordered and with no small parameter, liquids took a theoretical status between gases and solids with the historical tradition of hydrodynamic description as the starting point. We review different approaches to liquids as well as recent experimental and theoretical work, and propose that liquids do not need classifying in terms of their proximity to gases and solids or any categorizing for that matter. Instead, they are a unique system in their own class with a notably mixed dynamical state in contrast to pure dynamical states of solids and gases. We start with explaining how the first-principles approach to liquids is an intractable, exponentially complex problem of coupled non-linear oscillators with bifurcations. This is followed by a reduction of the problem based on liquid relaxation time τ representing non-perturbative treatment of strong interactions. On the basis of τ, solid-like high-frequency modes are predicted and we review related recent experiments. We demonstrate how the propagation of these modes can be derived by generalizing either hydrodynamic or elasticity equations. We comment on the historical trend to approach liquids using hydrodynamics and compare it to an alternative solid-like approach. We subsequently discuss how collective modes evolve with temperature and how this evolution affects liquid energy and heat capacity as well as other properties such as fast sound. Here, our emphasis is on understanding experimental data in real, rather than model, liquids. Highlighting the dominant role of solid-like high-frequency modes for liquid energy and heat capacity, we review a wide range of liquids: subcritical low-viscous liquids, supercritical state with two different dynamical and thermodynamic regimes separated by the Frenkel line, highly-viscous liquids in the glass transformation range and liquid-glass transition. We subsequently discuss the fairly recent area of liquid–liquid phase transitions, the area where the solid-like properties of liquids have become further apparent. We then discuss gas-like and solid-like approaches to quantum liquids and theoretical issues that are similar to the classical case. Finally, we summarize the emergent view of liquids as a unique system with a mixed dynamical state, and list several areas where interesting insights may appear and continue the extraordinary liquid story.},

    abstract = {Nosé has modified Newtonian dynamics so as to reproduce both the canonical and the isothermal-isobaric probability densities in the phase space of an N-body system. He did this by scaling time (with s) and distance (with 𝑉1/𝐷 in D dimensions) through Lagrangian equations of motion. The dynamical equations describe the evolution of these two scaling variables and their two conjugate momenta 𝑝𝑠 and 𝑝𝑣. Here we develop a slightly different set of equations, free of time scaling. We find the dynamical steady-state probability density in an extended phase space with variables x, 𝑝𝑥, V, ε̇, and ζ, where the x are reduced distances and the two variables ε̇ and ζ act as thermodynamic friction coefficients. We find that these friction coefficients have Gaussian distributions. From the distributions the extent of small-system non-Newtonian behavior can be estimated. We illustrate the dynamical equations by considering their application to the simplest possible case, a one-dimensional classical harmonic oscillator.},

    abstract = {Collective excitations in liquids are important for understanding liquid dynamical and thermodynamic properties. Gapped momentum states (GMS) are a notable feature of liquid dynamics predicted to operate in the transverse collective excitations. Here, we combine inelastic neutron scattering experiments, theory, and molecular dynamics modeling to study collective excitations and GMS in liquid Ga in a wide range of temperature and 𝑘 points. We find that all three lines of enquiry agree for the longitudinal liquid collective dynamics. In the transverse collective dynamics, the experiments agree with theory, modeling, as well as earlier x-ray experiments at larger 𝑘, whereas theory and modeling agree in a wide range of temperature and 𝑘 points. We observe the emergence and development of the 𝑘 gap in the transverse dispersion relation which increases with temperature and inverse of relaxation time as predicted theoretically.},

    abstract = {We develop an analytically solvable model for interacting two-dimensional Fermi liquids with separate collisional relaxation rates for parity-odd and parity-even Fermi surface deformations. Such a disparity of collisional lifetimes exists whenever scattering is restricted to inversion-symmetric Fermi surfaces, and should thus be a generic feature of two-dimensional Fermi liquids. It implies an additional unanticipated “tomographic” transport regime (in between the standard collisionless and hydrodynamic regimes) in which even-parity modes are overdamped while odd-parity modes are collisionless. We derive expressions for both the longitudinal and the transverse conductivity and discuss the collective mode spectrum along the collisionless-tomographic-hydrodynamic crossover. Longitudinal modes cross over from zero sound in the collisionless regime to hydrodynamic first sound in the tomographic and hydrodynamic regime, where odd-parity damping appears as a subleading correction to the lifetime. In charged Fermi liquids with long-range Coulomb coupling, these modes reduce to plasmons with a strongly suppressed odd-parity correction to the damping. The transverse response, by contrast, has a specific tomographic transport regime with two imaginary odd-parity modes, one of which requires a finite repulsive interaction, distinct from both the shear sound in the collisionless regime and an overdamped diffusive current mode in the hydrodynamic limit. Our work demonstrates that there are deep many-body aspects of interacting Fermi liquids, which are often thought to be well understood theoretically, remaining unexplored.},

Extensive molecular dynamics simulations for liquid aluminium and rubidium evidence a crossover in the diffusion coefficient at about 1.4 times the melting temperature 𝑇𝑚, indicating a profound change in the diffusion mechanism. The corresponding velocity autocorrelation functions demonstrate a decrease of the cage effect with a gradual set in of a power-law decay, they celebrate long time tail. This behavior is caused by a competition of density fluctuations near the melting point with vortex-type particle patterns from transverse currents in the hot fluid. The investigation of the velocity autocorrelation function evidences a gradual transition in dynamics with rising temperature. The competition between these two collective particle movements, one hindering and one enhancing the diffusion process, leads to a non-Arrhenius-type behavior of the diffusion coefficient around 1.4𝑇𝑚, which signals the transition from a dense to a fluidlike liquid dynamics in the potential energy landscape picture.},

With in silico study of liquified noble gases, liquid iron, liquid mercury, and model fluids, we established universal bilinear dependence of heat capacity on q-gap width, whereas the crossover precisely corresponds to the change in the excitation spectra.

It is an experimental fact that in the neighborhood of melting curves, including those measured at above-critical pressures and temperatures, all fluids have some short- and intermediate-range order and their excitation spectra contain high-frequency transverse waves. At high pressure, both smooth and sharp first-order phase transitions involving changes in the liquid structure and properties can occur between various liquid states. However, at sufficiently high temperatures, any liquid loses its identity and turns into an unstructured dense gas in which only longitudinal waves can propagate. We discuss theoretical and experimental evidence for the existence of a boundary between a ‘solid-like’ melt and a dense gas at supercritical pressures.},

The book is aimed at advanced undergraduates, graduate students and research workers in the earth and solid-state sciences who need to incorporate lattice dynamic treatments into their work. Applications include the use of lattice dynamics instabilities to study the origin of phase transitions in crystals and the use of vibrational spectra to obtain information about inter-atomic forces.},
